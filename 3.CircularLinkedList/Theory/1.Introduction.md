# Introduction

- In singly and doubly linked lists, the next pointer of last node is always null. However, in circular linked list, there is no ending. The last node(tail) points to the head node again.

- So, there is no null in circular linked list except when the list is empty.

- We have to be very careful while traversing because we can keep iterating it infinitely.
