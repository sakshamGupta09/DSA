# Advantages of Linked lists

- **Dynamic size**. The number of nodes in the list can increase and decrease on demand.

- **Dynamic memory allocation**. Memory is allocated as we create more nodes on demand and gets freed as we remove nodes from it.

- **Efficient memory utilization**. Since we do not require contiguous addresses, It leads to better memory utilization.
