# Limitations of Arrays

- **Static size**. The size of the array cannot expand or shrink at runtime(during program execution).

- **Preallocation of memory**. As soon as we create an array, the memory gets allocated upfront. Later if we don not fill it completely, it wastes memory.

- **One memory block**. Since it requires a contiguous range of addresses, It might happen that we do have space avilable to store data, but not in contiguous manner which leads to inefficient memory utilization.

- **Complex position based insertion and deletions**. If we want to perform insertion or deletion at the begining or any random index, some or all array elements need to be reshuffled.
