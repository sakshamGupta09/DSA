# Arrays

## How are arrays stored in memory

- One memory block (Contiguous memory addresses without any gaps) is allocated to hold all the elements of an array.

## But why array is stored in a contiguous manner

- To facilitate constant access time. We can access any array element in constant time.

- When we declare an array like arr = new Array(10), arr points to the base address in the memory where array is stored.

- When we do arr[2], it performs a calculation to reach second element from the base address.

- arr[2] = baseAddress + (offset which is 2) * (Memory occupied to store a single array element).

- And that's also why array index starts from 0.

- That's how arrays can give us any element is contant time because all we need is one addition and one multiplication.
