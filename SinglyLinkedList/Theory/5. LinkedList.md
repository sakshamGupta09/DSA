# Linked List

- Linked list consists of a sequence of nodes.

- Each node consists of a data field and pointer to the next node.

## How are lists stored in memory

- Every node of a linked list is an object and hence it is stored as an object in heap.

- We do not need contiguous memory as we are only storing individual objects and somehow linking them.

- Since we do not have any entry point or base address we keep a head node which holds the address of the first node of the list.

- Every node will keep the address of some other node.

- The last node will not have any next address and will point to null;
